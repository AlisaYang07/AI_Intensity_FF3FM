# AI_Intensity_FF3FM
## Abstract 

This paper introduces a new dataset on Artificial Intelligence (AI) skill intensity of companies in the Dow
Jones and S&P 500 obtained from online job boards. This AI-intensity is then used to relate to ex-post
returns for the years 2015-2020. I find that most of the excess returns of the portfolio are explained by Fama
and French 3-factor model. I discussthe drawbacks and benefit from using job boards as a novel information
source. 

The following image depicts the cummulative return of Low, High and High - Low AI Intensity portfolios comprised of companies in the SP500
